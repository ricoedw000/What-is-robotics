lightbot and robomind are the same but diffenrent objectives, also lightbot can jump and robomind cant.thay both have the same
mecanics.The games challenge your mind to get to a point or get something.I couldnt fnish a game even dough i lighted up all the square
,it was anoying so i just closed the game.i dont like the way the game tells us a spesific way to reach our goals.
