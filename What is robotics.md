# What-is-robotics
Robotics is a branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electronics 
engineering, computer science. Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as 
well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.
These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans and replicate human actions. Robots can be 
used in any situation and for any purpose, but today many are used in dangerous environments,including bomb detection and 
deactivation, manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots can take on any form but some are made to 
resemble humans in appearance.Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything ahuman 
can do. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature, contributing to the field of bio-inspired robotics.
The concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times. 
 Robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots
serve various practical purposes, whether domestically, commercially, or militarily. Many robots are built to do jobs that are 
hazardous to people such as defusing bombs, finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring 
mines and shipwrecks.Robotics is a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation of robots. This field 
overlaps with electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, mechatronics, nanotechnology and bioengineering.
